##The GS_LV Project
This repository acts as workshop for the development and testing of a future version of G_String, a software tool allowing generalists to perform Generalizability Analysis of performance evaluations.
In contrast to the more general statistical tools, G_String does not require a great deal of mathematical sophistication. It guides the user through the accepted mathematical algorithms.
Until the present, G_String was programmed in traditional Oracle Java 8. But over the past 15 years the software industry has made great progress. 
The project GS_LV is an attempt for G_String, not only to catch up, but to hopefully keep step with future development more easily.
The key to this development was to incorporate G_String with its own build tool - Gradle.
